# usbautofan
USB Fan Automation for Raspberry Pi

## Hardware Requirements
* Raspberry Pi
* USB Fan (I used a CPU fan with a 3pin to USB adapter)

## Software Requirements
* If you're using a Raspberry 4, make sure your bootloader is at least on version 00137ad
   - To check, run `sudo rpi-eeprom-update` and to update run `sudo rpi-eeprom-update -d -a`
* `apt-get install build-essential`
* [Python3](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/generic-python-install-python3#linux)
* [uhubctl](https://github.com/mvp/uhubctl)

## Setup
### Targeting
Firstly, we need to figure out which port we need to address with uhubctl. There is some info in the [uhubctl documentation](https://github.com/mvp/uhubctl#raspberry-pi-4b) and we can do some testing:

Make sure the fan is connected and reboot to be sure. Fan should be running.
Run `uhubctl` to list all USB hubs and ports. The syntax for uhubctl is `uhubctl -l [hub] -p [port] -a [action]`, try out some hubs (e.g. 2 or 1-1) and ports (1-4) with action 0 (off) until your fan turns off but (if applicable) other USB devices still work.

For reference, I'm using a Raspberry Pi 4B and have the Fan connected to the lower USB2 port. As per the uhubctl documentation, my command is `uhubctl -l 1-1 -a 0`.

If that command works for you, you don't need to change anything in the python script. If you need another command, make sure to change line 23 in the code accordingly.

### Installation
1. Download `usbautofan.py` and place it in `/root/usbautofan/`
   - Change uhubctl command if needed (see Targeting section)
   - (Optional) If you want to, you can change the maxtemp and mintemp variables. The numbers are degrees C without decimals. maxtemp determines when the Fan will turn on while mintemp will determine when it turns off. Between the two no action will be done. You can also change the intervall if you would like the process to check more/less often.
2. Run `sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/usbautofan.service` and paste this:
```
[Unit]
Description=USB Fan Automation
After=mult-user.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/env python3 /root/usbautofan/usbautofan.py

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
3. Refresh Daemon and enable the service:
```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable usbautofan.service
```
4. Check if it's running:
```
systemctl status timestamp.service
```
